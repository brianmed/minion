=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Minion::Backend> is an abstract base class for L<Minion> backends, like
L<Minion::Backend::Pg>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Minion::Backend> implements the following attributes.

=head2 minion

  my $minion = $backend->minion;
  $backend   = $backend->minion(Minion->new);

L<Minion> object this backend belongs to.

=head1 METHODS

L<Minion::Backend> inherits all methods from L<Mojo::Base> and implements the
following new ones.

=head2 dequeue

  my $job_info = $backend->dequeue($worker_id, 0.5);
  my $job_info = $backend->dequeue($worker_id, 0.5, {queues => ['important']});

Wait a given amount of time in seconds for a job, dequeue it and transition from
C<inactive> to C<active> state, or return C<undef> if queues were empty. Meant
to be overloaded in a subclass.

These options are currently available:

=over 2

=item queues

  queues => ['important']

One or more queues to dequeue jobs from, defaults to C<default>.

=back

These fields are currently available:

=over 2

=item args

  args => ['foo', 'bar']

Job arguments.

=item id

  id => '10023'

Job ID.

=item retries

  retries => 3

Number of times job has been retried.

=item task

  task => 'foo'

Task name.

=back

=head2 enqueue

  my $job_id = $backend->enqueue('foo');
  my $job_id = $backend->enqueue(foo => [@args]);
  my $job_id = $backend->enqueue(foo => [@args] => {priority => 1});

Enqueue a new job with C<inactive> state. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

These options are currently available:

=over 2

=item attempts

  attempts => 25

Number of times performing this job will be attempted, with a delay based on
L<Minion/"backoff"> after the first attempt, defaults to C<1>.

=item delay

  delay => 10

Delay job for this many seconds (from now).

=item parents

  parents => [$id1, $id2, $id3]

One or more existing jobs this job depends on, and that need to have
transitioned to the state C<finished> before it can be processed.

=item priority

  priority => 5

Job priority, defaults to C<0>.

=item queue

  queue => 'important'

Queue to put job in, defaults to C<default>.

=back

=head2 fail_job

  my $bool = $backend->fail_job($job_id, $retries);
  my $bool = $backend->fail_job($job_id, $retries, 'Something went wrong!');
  my $bool = $backend->fail_job(
    $job_id, $retries, {whatever => 'Something went wrong!'});

Transition from C<active> to C<failed> state, and if there are attempts
remaining, transition back to C<inactive> with a delay based on
L<Minion/"backoff">. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

=head2 finish_job

  my $bool = $backend->finish_job($job_id, $retries);
  my $bool = $backend->finish_job($job_id, $retries, 'All went well!');
  my $bool = $backend->finish_job(
    $job_id, $retries, {whatever => 'All went well!'});

Transition from C<active> to C<finished> state. Meant to be overloaded in a
subclass.

=head2 job_info

  my $job_info = $backend->job_info($job_id);

Get information about a job, or return C<undef> if job does not exist. Meant to
be overloaded in a subclass.

  # Check job state
